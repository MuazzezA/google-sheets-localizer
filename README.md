# Google Sheets Localizer

A tool to fetch localization strings from a Google Sheets document and generate translation files for your project.

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the localizer tool in your project.

### 1. Create Your Google Sheet

- Create a new Google Sheet to manage your localization keys and translations.
- Structure your sheet as follows:
    - **Row 1:** First column should be the key name (e.g. `greeting`), subsequent columns should be language codes (e.g. `en`, `tr`, `fr`).
    - **Row 2 onwards:** Fill in your translation keys and corresponding translations for each language.

Example:

| Key       | en        | tr           | fr          |
| --------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| greeting  | Hello     | Merhaba      | Bonjour     |
| farewell  | Goodbye   | Hoşça kal    | Au revoir   |

### 2. Share Your Google Sheet

- Share the Google Sheet with the email found in your Google Cloud credentials JSON under the `client_email` field.
- Give at least **Viewer** access so the API can read the sheet.
---

### 3. Setup Google Cloud Credentials

- Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Enable the Google Sheets API for your project.
- Create a Service Account and generate a JSON key file.
- Download the JSON credentials file and save it somewhere safe.

### 4. Configure `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following keys:

```env
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id_here
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/absolute/path/to/your/credentials.json
GOOGLE_SHEET_RANGE=Sheet1!A1:Z1000
```

### 5. Run the Localizer

Run the command to fetch the latest translations and generate localization files:
> **Note:** By default, the tool starts reading data from the **3rd row** of the sheet (assuming the 1st row contains headers and the 2nd row contains the first data row).

```bash
npx generate-localize
```
The tool will:

Read the Google Sheet starting from row 2 (row 1 is assumed to be headers).
Generate a JSON file with translations.
Generate a TypeScript types file for localization keys.
Save output files into the localize folder at the root of your project.


### 6. Use Generated Files in Your Project

- The generated `localize/translations.json` contains all translations.
- The generated `localize/localized-keys.d.ts` contains typed localization keys.
- Import these files where needed in your project.

### 7. Notes

- Ensure the Google credentials JSON file path is absolute.
- The tool expects the first row of the sheet to contain headers.
- Sharing the sheet correctly with the service account email is required.
- The output directory (`localize`) will be created if it doesn’t exist.


### Troubleshooting

- If you get an error about missing `.env` variables, double-check your `.env` file location and contents.
- If the credentials file is not found, verify the absolute path is correct.
- Make sure your service account has Viewer access to the Google Sheet.
